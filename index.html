What is COVID-19 (Corona-Virus) ?<br><br>
COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown <br>
before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause <br>
illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from <br>
the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome <br>
(SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p><br>

<h3>Covaxin</h3><br>

COVAXINTM, India's indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by Bharat Biotech is developed in collaboration with the Indian Council <br>
of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and <br>
manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility. The vaccine received DCGI approval <br>
for Phase I & II Human Clinical Trials and the trials commenced across India from July, 2020. <br>
After successful completion of the interim analysis from the Phase 1 & 2 clinical trials of COVAXINTM, Bharat Biotech <br>
received DCGI approval for Phase 3 clinical trials in 26,000 participants in over 25 centres across India. <br><br>
<h3>Covishield</h3><br>
<img src="https://s.w-x.co/in-sii.jpg" alt="" width="360"><br><br>
The company has tied up with pharma firm AstraZeneca, which is developing a vaccine named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in partnership with <br>
Oxford University. It is reported that Serum Institute would provide 10 crore (100 million) doses of the vaccine in India <br>
and other low and middle-income countries. It is estimated to be priced at ₹225 (around $3) per dose. In September 2020, <br>
trials were halted by DCGI after a volunteer in Oxford developed illness following a dosage, but were soon resumed after consent <br>
by the British regulators. In December 2020, SII sought emergency approval for the vaccine developed with AstraZeneca. India's <br>
drugs regulator has approved Covishield, being manufactured by the Serum Institute, for restricted emergency use in the <br>
country. They have also reached an agreement with Novavax for the development and commercialisation of Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373 <br>
COVID‑19 vaccine candidate in India and other low and middle-income countries.[27][28] The company will also produce Codagenix's <br>
nasally administered COVID-19 vaccine, CDX-005.<br><br>
<h3>AZD1222</h3><br>
<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSxCqJasH2S718pAwIE-HI8WsVo9zd11MBSQQ&usqp=CAU" alt="AZD1222-img" width="480"><br><br>
In March 2020, the company announced that it would be donating PPE, including 9 million face masks, to help support various <br>
international health organisations mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, the Chief Executive, Pascal Soriot, reported <br>
that the company was working with GlaxoSmithKline and the University of Cambridge to develop a new laboratory capable of <br>
conducting 30,000 COVID-19 tests per day. The company also announced plans for a clinical trial to assess the potential use <br>
of Calquence in the treatment of COVID-19. In June 2020, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) <br>
confirmed that the third phase of testing for potential vaccines developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca would <br>
begin in July 2020.[86] One of them, AZD1222, reached phase III trials. On 23 November 2020, Oxford University/AstraZeneca <br>
announced the coronavirus vaccine's successful trial, preventing 70% of people developing symptoms.[88] The researchers <br>
think that the figure may be as high as 90% by tweaking the dose. In January 2021 India approved the COVID-19 vaccine developed <br>
by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, paving the way for a huge immunisation campaign in the world’s second most populous <br>
country. It was announced that the AstraZeneca/Oxford shot would be made locally by the Serum Institute of India (SII) with a
brand name COVISHIELD. </p><br>
